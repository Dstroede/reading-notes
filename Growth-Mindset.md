### What a growth mindset means to me is

- To be okay with *failure*
- To look at challenges as an *opportunity* for growth
- To bring *positive* energy to each day
- Keep moving ~~forward~~

### 3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset

1. Identify __3 people__ I can confide in who will reaffirm my ambitions. Talk to them when morale is low.
2. Write out my __"why"__ in the front of my notebook. Look at this reminder before each class.
3. Work out __early__ in the morning. It will set the tone for taking on challenges for the rest of the day.
