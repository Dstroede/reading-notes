# Class 10 Notes

## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A syntax error is missing something simple like a curly brace a parentheses or spelling erros. Logic erros is when the code is not doing what you are aiming to have it acheive.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

In the las lab I could not get my form to submit and I realized all I had missed was closing the form too early. This I suppose would be a syntax error.

A good example of a logic error was when I had first created my nested loop I was looping throught the wrong hourly cookies array.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I think this impact the goal of simply understanding coding in general because I'm starting to realize that many times syntax errors can be found simply by doing console logs to see if loops are running and such and then logic errors are often a little more complex and take a bit more brain power and toying with.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

Lets say that the car is you your code a deubgger basically allows you to run seperate parts of the car to find where the error was. So lets say in your car(code) that there is a leak in the coolant (error in a for lopp). You could isolate the coolant container, the hose, all the way to the engine and see where the coolant is leaking (you can run the loop outside of everything and see where its not working).

## Define what a breakpoint is.

break points are basically where you want the code to pause.

## What is the call stack?

A call stack gives all the active functions within the code.
