# Class 7 Notes

Domain Modeling

## Explain why we need domain modeling.

Its basically detailing out what you are trying to accomplish and narrowing that vision in by creating parameters.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

They decrease the accessibilty of a page, it creates too many  complex tags, and because they are not as responsive as div, sections and suchg

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

Table this is the the shell of all the information it holds all data

td (table data) this is tall the data you want to display

tr (Table row) thies element create a new row for the data to display in

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

Its basically an object but works similar to a function. The advatage seems to be that its more repeatable.


## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

This in a constructor can be used by several objects while this in a object only refers to the object.


## Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

So basically we can use a prototype and link it to a constructor which can be linked to our objects we already created for salmon cookies?


NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
