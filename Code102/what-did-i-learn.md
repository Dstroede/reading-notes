# What Did I Learn

* I think its been a very interseting lesson to teach how to trasnfer git from application to application.

* This lesson also forced me to continue to practice markdown.

* One outcome of this lesson is that I'm building confidence with the terminal. When  we first started playing in the terminal, I was very intimidated to work with it and navigate. Now I'm finding it to be straight forward. At this point, I feel like I'm having a conversation with my computer.
