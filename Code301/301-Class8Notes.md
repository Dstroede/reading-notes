## What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

It means that you are requiring the application to go through a bunch of small resources to access a request. It creates more load for the web server to go through which in-turn increases the bandwith need for the request and slows the response down.

## What status code does a successful GET request return?

HTTP status code 200 (OK).

## What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

404 (Not Found).

## What status code does a successful POST request return?

HTTP status code 201 (Created).

## What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
