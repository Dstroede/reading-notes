# Prep: Git Practice

## How did this go, overall?

* Overall this went relatively well. I knew the commands although the webside would not register some of the shortcuts to the result.

## What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

* No questions. My main observation is that the order that you go in for each task makes a big difference in getting to the correct end result.

## How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

* Took me just under 30 min. I thought it would take me 10 min.
