# Class 13 Notes

## Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

It allows a user to, in a sense, keep the progress they have made on a website. Such as previously clicked on links and recent seraches and such. Gives for a better user experience than restarting every time.

## What information should not be stored in local storage?

sensitive user data.

## Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

It only stores strings. You use the json.stringify and json.parse methods.
