# CSS Notes

## What is the purpose of CSS?

CSS controls the look and style of the web page. HTML determines the content while the CSS determines how the content is shown.

## What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

* External CSS- this is where you html is linked to another file. this helps keep the website organized because you can go to one file to view the contnet changes and another to deal with only style.
* Internal CSS This is where you create a style element within your html file. 
* Inline CSS- this type of CSS is similar to instyle but its tyupically used for a singel element. such as styling just an image.

## Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.

p {
    color: red;
}
