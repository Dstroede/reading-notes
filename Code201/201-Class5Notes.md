the background color should be the main color asscoicated with your site.

For the foreground you can use a related color but its importnat that it has a contrast that make it readable for the user.

## Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

If there is a specific kind of content associated with the site then I'd use that for the background. If not I can go to a palate wheel and find a palate that gives me background outline and text colors.
