# Class 6 Notes

## To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

In a previous job, we had something called a "who am I". This was a practice of everytime we had a new hire we would go through our employees and each person had to go through their life story. It was an amazing tool to learn about the struggles people had, the families they grew up in, the relationships they built and what life events built who they are. It was an amazing tool and it gave a feeling of being understood and being heard. It definitely made it feel like you could be yourself to all the upper admins in the department.

## How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

I think the best way to implement this going forward is just using great communication. Explaining to managaement how you work best where you will need help. What motivates you and what can deflate you. As a manager its your job to understand the people you are managing and how to build cohesiveness within the team.
